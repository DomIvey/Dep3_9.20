# DEPLOYMENT 3.1 â€“ 9.20.23
# POST INCIDENT REPORT


## What was the reason for the incident?

The version of code that the URL was connected to was not ready for deployment. This is why it failed in Jenkins the first time. The incorrect version (V2) was used for the url shortener. 

## What counts as an incident?

Anything with customer-visible negative consequences. In most cases this will be an outage or downtime event but some non-outage incidents include severe performance degradations and security events.

## When should I file an incident report?

Preferably after the incident is resolved. Or at least don't consider it even remotely a priority to do the paperwork in the middle of an ongoing issue. But if possible do think about recording timeline information that isn't in Slack (such as discussions on a Zoom call) which might otherwise be lost, so that you will have them for the report later.

For larger incidents we will hold a retrospective meeting to discuss how things went, most of which should be added to the incident report afterwards for archival purposes.
